# Introduction
If you need to add a functionality to evolUX there are many ways to do so, depending on what you are trying to implement. However generically for most substantial functions you will need to follow a particular structure based on the MVC and UI/API pipeline. Here we will try to give an example and explain superficially and exemplify how to follow this structure and implement what you need where you need it for the most common approach for evolUX development.
